Gimme Drawer
============

A bookmarklet for getting those hard-to-reach images with [Gimme Bar](https://gimmebar.com/).

Installation
------------

[Go here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/bentoncreation/gimme-drawer/blob/master/bookmarklet.html) and drag the link to your brower's bookmark bar.

Usage
-----

1. Find yourself a page with a background image or some slippery photo you can't get a grip on with your cursor.

2. Click the Gimme Drawer bookmarklet and BAM! you've got all the page's images and background images (from body, div and td elements) waiting for you at the top of your browser window.

3. Click your normal Gimme Bar bookmarklet (if you haven't already done so).

4. Drag only the pretty things to Gimme Bar.

To do
-----

* Only show images above certain dimensions (maybe 250px per side? can this be done with background images?)
* Make clicking the bookmarklet a second time destroy the drawer (rather than create another)
* Learn teh Javascripts
